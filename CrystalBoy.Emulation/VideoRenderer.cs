	/// <remarks>
	/// All video renderers must inherit from this class.
	/// Generally, video renderers will not inherit directly from this class,
	/// but will instead inherit from the generic class <see cref="VideoRenderer{TRenderObject}"/>,
	/// which provides strong coupling with a particular host.
	/// All members of this class should be callable from another thread.
	/// The implementor must take care of the synchrnonization where needed for its specific case.
	/// For the time being, implementors can safely assume that drawing operations will only be called sequentially, even while coming from non UI threads.
	/// I.e. While required to be thread-safe, the renderers do not need to be multithread-safe.
	/// </remarks>
