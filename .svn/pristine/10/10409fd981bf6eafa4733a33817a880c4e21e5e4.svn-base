The GB Main Clock runs at 4194304 Hz
There are timers running at 4096 Hz, 16384 Hz, 65536 Hz and 262144 Hz.
We run the emulator on a per frame basis, meaning that we execute 70224 cycles for each frame.
The LCD refresh and the timers are not synchronized, meaning we have to handle timer values specifically for each frame.

An emulated frame will always begin at line 0 and end after 70224 cycles or a bit more (depending on instruction cycle count).
When LCD is disabled, LY will always be 0, and mode always 0, no LCD interruptions (VBI / STAT) will be raised.
On LCD enable, the cycle counter is reset, and the LCD begins at line 0.
At the beginning of each frame, the raster line counter (LY) is reset at 0.

For reference only: Originally, emulated frames used to begin at VBlank, which made VBI handling easier.

For each raster line: (144 total)
Mode 2 will last 80 cycles
Mode 3 will last 172 cycles
Mode 0 will last 204 cycles (HBlank)
Followed by vertical blank: (10 raster lines total)
Mode 1 will last 4560 cycles (VBlank)

For timer synchronization, we use a 4096 Hz reference timer.
Each frame, we keep track of timer shift in cycles.
4096 Hz means 1024 cycles between each tick.
Meaning that between in each frame, 70224 % 1024 = 592 cycles are remaining.
Once this timer is synchronized, we use its reference timing as a base for the GB programmable timer and the divider.
